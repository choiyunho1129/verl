    "problem": "The points $P = (x_1,y_1)$ and $Q = (x_2,y_2)$ are the intersections of the parabola $y^2 = 1292ax,$ where $a > 0,$ and a line passing through the focus of the parabola.  Then the distance $PQ$ can be expressed in the form $c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + c_3 a,$ where $c_1,$ $c_2,$ and $c_3$ are constants.  Compute $c_1 + c_2 + c_3.$",
