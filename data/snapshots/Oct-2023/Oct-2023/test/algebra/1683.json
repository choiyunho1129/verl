    "problem": "Rationalize the denominator of $\\frac{\\sqrt{21}+\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{21}-\\sqrt{12}}$. The answer can be written as $\\frac{A+B\\sqrt{C}}{D}$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are integers, $D$ is positive, and $C$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. If the greatest common divisor of $A$, $B$, and $D$ is 1, find $A+B+C+D$.",
