    "problem": "Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is 3 times halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",
