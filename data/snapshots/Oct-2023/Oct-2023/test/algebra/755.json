    "problem": "A map of the town that Annie and Barbara live in can be represented by the Cartesian plane. Annie is located at $(9,-2)$ and Barbara says she is located at $(-3,2)$. They agree to meet the midpoint of their current locations. However, it turns out that Barbara read the map wrong, and she is actually at $(5,-5)$. What is the positive difference in the $x$-coordinates of where they agreed to meet and where they should actually meet?",
