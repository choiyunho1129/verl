    "problem": "A player chooses one of the numbers 516 through 519. After the choice has been made, two regular four-sided (tetrahedral) dice are rolled, with the sides of the dice numbered 516 through 519. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of exactly one die after it is rolled, then the player wins $\\$657.$ If the number chosen appears on the bottom of both of the dice, then the player wins $\\$813.$ If the number chosen does not appear on the bottom of either of the dice, the player loses $\\$323.$ What is the expected return to the player, in dollars, for one roll of the dice? Give your answer as a fraction.",
