    "problem": "On my ping-pong team there are five times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 800 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",
