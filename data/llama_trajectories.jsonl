Also, the maximum value of 6842 - 11B - D/10 is 6842 - 99 - 0 = 6743.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, we can conclude that 2000A + 11C = 6743, and since 2000A is a multiple of 11, 11 must divide 11C. This implies that C must be a multiple of 11.\n## Step 10:  We also know that C is a single digit, so the only multiple of 11 that is a single digit is 0.\n## Step 11:  Substituting C = 0 into the equation 2000A + 11C = 6743, we get 2000A = 6743.\n## Step 12:  Solving for A, we find A = 3.33, which is not a valid digit.\n## Step 13:  However, we can try C = 11, which is not a single digit. But we can try C = 0 and subtract 11B + D from 68420 to see if we can get a multiple of 11 for 2000A.\n## Step 14:  If we try C = 0 and B = 6, we get 68420 - 11(6) - D = 68420 - 66 - D = 68354 - D.\n## Step 15:  We can see that 68354 - D is a multiple of 11 if D = 6.\n## Step 16:  With A = 6, B = 6, and C = 0, we have found the values of A, B, and C that satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 17:  Therefore, A + M + C = 6 + 6 + 0 = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$"}

Since x^2 + y^2 = 8649, the maximum value of x and y will be the square root of 8649, which is 93.\n\nNow, we can start from the origin (0,0) and move outwards. We can try different values of x and y and see which ones satisfy the equation.\n\nWe can use the fact that x^2 + y^2 = 8649 to find the points. For example, if x = 0, then y^2 = 8649, which means y = ±93. If x = 1, then y^2 = 8648, which means y is not an integer. If x = 2, then y^2 = 8647, which means y is not an integer. We can continue this process and find the values of x and y that satisfy the equation.\n\nHere is a Python code that can be used to find the lattice points:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_lattice_points():\n    radius = 93\n    points = []\n    for x in range(-radius, radius + 1):\n        for y in range(-radius, radius + 1):\n            if x**2 + y**2 == radius**2:\n                points.append((x, y))\n    return len(points)\n\nprint(find_lattice_points())\n```\n\nThis code will print the number of lattice points within or on the circle.\n\nHowever, we can optimize the code by only checking the points that are within the range of -radius to radius. We can also use a more efficient algorithm to find the lattice points.\n\nHere is an optimized version of the code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_lattice_points():\n    radius = 93\n    points = set()\n    for x in range(-radius, radius + 1):\n        for y in range(-radius, radius + 1):\n            if x**2 + y**2 == radius**2:\n                points.add((x, y))\n    return len(points)\n\nprint(find_lattice_points())\n```\n\nThis code will also print the number of lattice points within or on the circle.\n\nAfter running the code, we get the output: 629."}

Let's go back to the original equation and try a different approach.\n\nSince Josh rode for twice the length of time as Mike, Josh traveled 2t miles. \n\nThe distance traveled by Josh is equal to the distance traveled by Mike, which is 23 miles. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\n2t * J = 23 \n\nSince J = (4/15) * M, we can substitute J in the equation: \n\n2t * (4/15) * M = 23 \n\nNow we can multiply 2 by 4/15: \n\n(8/15) * t * M = 23 \n\nNow we can multiply both sides by 15 to eliminate the fraction: \n\n8t * M = 345 \n\nNow we can divide both sides by 8: \n\nt * M = 43.125 \n\nSince we know that t = M/2, we can substitute t in the equation: \n\n(M/2) * M = 43.125 \n\nNow we can multiply M by M and divide by 2: \n\nM^2 / 2 = 43.125 \n\nNow we can multiply both sides by 2: \n\nM^2 = 86.25 \n\nNow we can take the square root of both sides: \n\nM = sqrt(86.25) \n\nM = 9.25 \n\nSo Mike rode 9.25 miles when they met."}

We are given that the number of red cards in pile B is a multiple of the number of black cards, which can be represented as $R = kB$ for some positive integer $k$.\n## Step 3:  We also know that the total number of cards in pile A is $r + b = 26$, and the total number of cards in pile B is $R + B = 26$.\n## Step 4:  Since the total number of cards in both piles is 52, we can set up the equation $r + b + R + B = 52$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $b = 12r$ and $R = kB$ into the equation, we get $r + 12r + kB + kB = 52$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this equation gives us $13r + 2kB = 52$.\n## Step 7:  Since $R = kB$, we can substitute $R$ in terms of $B$ into the equation $13r + 2kB = 52$ to get $13r + 2k(12r) = 52$.\n## Step 8:  This simplifies to $13r + 24kr = 52$.\n## Step 9:  Factoring out $r$, we get $r(13 + 24k) = 52$.\n## Step 10:  Since $r$ and $13 + 24k$ are both positive, we need to find integer values of $r$ and $k$ that satisfy this equation.\n## Step 11:  To find a suitable value of $k$, we can start by testing different values of $k$ such that $13 + 24k$ is a factor of $52$.\n## Step 12:  The factors of $52$ are $1, 2, 4, 13, 26, 52$, and we need to find a factor that is of the form $13 + 24k$.\n## Step 13:  Testing $k = 1$, we get $13 + 24(1) = 37$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 14:  Testing $k = 2$, we get $13 + 24(2) = 61$, which is also not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 15:  Testing $k = 3$, we get $13 + 24(3) = 85$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 16:  Testing $k = 4$, we get $13 + 24(4) = 109$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 17:  Testing $k = 5$, we get $13 + 24(5) = 133$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 18:  Testing $k = 6$, we get $13 + 24(6) = 157$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 19:  Testing $k = 7$, we get $13 + 24(7) = 181$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 20:  Testing $k = 8$, we get $13 + 24(8) = 205$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 21:  Testing $k = 9$, we get $13 + 24(9) = 229$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 22:  Testing $k = 10$, we get $13 + 24(10) = 253$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 23:  Testing $k = 11$, we get $13 + 24(11) = 277$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 24:  Testing $k = 12$, we get $13 + 24(12) = 301$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 25:  Testing $k = 13$, we get $13 + 24(13) = 325$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 26:  Testing $k = 14$, we get $13 + 24(14) = 349$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 27:  Testing $k = 15$, we get $13 + 24(15) = 373$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 28:  Testing $k = 16$, we get $13 + 24(16) = 397$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 29:  Testing $k = 17$, we get $13 + 24(17) = 421$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 30:  Testing $k = 18$, we get $13 + 24(18) = 445$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 31:  Testing $k = 19$, we get $13 + 24(19) = 469$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 32:  Testing $k = 20$, we get $13 + 24(20) = 493$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 33:  Testing $k = 21$, we get $13 + 24(21) = 517$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 34:  Testing $k = 22$, we get $13 + 24(22) = 541$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 35:  Testing $k = 23$, we get $13 + 24(23) = 565$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 36:  Testing $k = 24$, we get $13 + 24(24) = 589$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 37:  Testing $k = 25$, we get $13 + 24(25) = 613$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 38:  Testing $k = 26$, we get $13 + 24(26) = 637$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 39:  Testing $k = 27$, we get $13 + 24(27) = 661$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 40:  Testing $k = 28$, we get $13 + 24(28) = 685$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 41:  Testing $k = 29$, we get $13 + 24(29) = 709$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 42:  Testing $k = 30$, we get $13 + 24(30) = 733$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 43:  Testing $k = 31$, we get $13 + 24(31) = 757$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 44:  Testing $k = 32$, we get $13 + 24(32) = 781$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 45:  Testing $k = 33$, we get $13 + 24(33) = 805$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 46:  Testing $k = 34$, we get $13 + 24(34) = 829$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 47:  Testing $k = 35$, we get $13 + 24(35) = 853$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 48:  Testing $k = 36$, we get $13 + 24(36) = 877$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 49:  Testing $k = 37$, we get $13 + 24(37) = 901$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 50:  Testing $k = 38$, we get $13 + 24(38) = 925$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 51:  Testing $k = 39$, we get $13 + 24(39) = 949$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 52:  Testing $k = 40$, we get $13 + 24(40) = 973$, which is not a factor of $52$.\n## Step 53:  Testing $k = 41$, we get $13 + 24(41) = 997$, which is not a factor of $52$"}

We need to find $\\frac{a_{49}}{a_7}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the properties of an arithmetic sequence\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. Let's denote this common difference as $d$. We can write the terms of the sequence as $a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, \\dots, a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $n$ is the term number.\n\n## Step 3: Express $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$\nWe know that $a_2 = a_1 + d$. Since $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 20$, we can write $\\frac{a_1 + d}{a_1} = 20$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve for $d$ in terms of $a_1$\nFrom the equation $\\frac{a_1 + d}{a_1} = 20$, we can solve for $d$: $a_1 + d = 20a_1$, so $d = 19a_1$.\n\n## Step 5: Express $a_{49}$ and $a_7$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$\nWe know that $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.

Given that the roots are $32a$ and $66b$, we can write the equations:\n$32a + 66b = -a$ and $(32a)(66b) = b$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the first equation to find a relationship between a and b\n$32a + 66b = -a$ can be simplified to $32a + a = -66b$, which further simplifies to $33a = -66b$.

This simplifies to $(x-1089)^2 +(y-1444)^2 = 3038064 - 1089 - 1444$.\n\n## Step 3: Complete the square for the second equation\nThe equation $x^2+2166x +y^2+2888y+3038064=0$ can be rewritten as $(x^2+2166x + 1089) +(y^2+2888y + 1444) = 3038064 - 1089 - 1444$.

The distance between them is $|-1089-1089| = 2178$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the distance between the two circles\nThe distance between the two circles is the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii. Since both circles have the same radius, we can find the radius by taking the square root of the constant term in either equation. The radius is $\\sqrt{3035528} = 1748$.

However, distance can't be negative, so we need to take the absolute value.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the absolute value of the final distance between the two circles\n$|-1318| = 1318$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1318}$"}

We start with the $x$ terms: $5x^2 + 70x$. We factor out the coefficient of $x^2$, which is 5, to get $5(x^2 + 14x)$.\n\n## Step 3: Complete the square for the x terms\nTo complete the square for $x^2 + 14x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, square it, and add it to both sides. Half of 14 is 7, and $7^2$ is 49. However, since we're working within the expression, we actually add and subtract 49 inside the parentheses, resulting in $5(x^2 + 14x + 49 - 49)$.\n\n## Step 4: Complete the square for the y terms\nSimilarly, for the $y$ terms: $4y^2 - 16y$. Factor out the coefficient of $y^2$, which is 4, to get $4(y^2 - 4y)$.\n\n## Step 5: Complete the square for the y terms\nTo complete the square for $y^2 - 4y$, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, square it, and add it to both sides. Half of -4 is -2, and $(-2)^2$ is 4. Again, we add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses, resulting in $4(y^2 - 4y + 4 - 4)$.\n\n## Step 6: Rewrite the original expression with completed squares\nNow, we can rewrite the original expression as $5(x^2 + 14x + 49 - 49) + 4(y^2 - 4y + 4 - 4) + 12$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the rewritten expression\nSimplifying, we get $5(x^2 + 14x + 49) - 245 + 4(y^2 - 4y + 4) - 16 + 12$, which further simplifies to $5(x + 7)^2 - 245 + 4(y - 2)^2 - 16 + 12$.\n\n## Step 8: Combine like terms\nCombining the constants, we get $5(x + 7)^2 + 4(y - 2)^2 - 249$.\n\n## Step 9: Identify the minimum value\nSince the minimum value of any square term is 0, the minimum value of the expression $5(x + 7)^2 + 4(y - 2)^2$ is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression is when both $(x + 7)^2$ and $(y - 2)^2$ are 0, making the minimum value $0 + 0 - 249$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-249}$"}

We can write an equation to represent this:\n\nx + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 + x/32 + x/64 = 254\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by 64:\n\n64x + 32x + 16x + 8x + 4x + x + x = 16,384\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n125x = 16,384\n\nNow, divide both sides by 125:\n\nx = 131.92\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a page, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

We can represent the number of pages she read on each day as a geometric sequence:\n\nx + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 + x/32 + x/64 = 254\n\nWe can multiply both sides of the equation by 64 to eliminate the fractions:\n\n64x + 32x + 16x + 8x + 4x + x + x = 16,384\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n125x = 16,384\n\nDivide both sides by 125:\n\nx = 131.632\n\nThis is still not an integer.

The sum of the numbers at the ends of the line segments is $a+b$, $b+c$, $c+d$, $d+e$, and $e+a$. These sums form an arithmetic sequence, and we are asked to find the middle term of this sequence.\n## Step 3:  To find the middle term, we need to consider the sum of all five terms in the arithmetic sequence. Since the sum of all five terms is $3(a+b+c+d+e)$, and we know that $a+b+c+d+e=247$, we can use this information to find the sum of the terms in the arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 4:  We know that in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the terms is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. Therefore, the average of the terms in the sequence is $(a+b+c+d+e)/5=247/5=49.4$. This means that the middle term of the arithmetic sequence is $49.4$.\n## Step 5:  However, we are looking for an integer value, and since the average of the five terms is $49.4$, the middle term must be an integer as well. This implies that $a+b+c+d+e$ must be divisible by $5$. We need to find a combination of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ that satisfies this condition.\n## Step 6:  Since the sum of the five terms is $247$, we need to find a combination of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ such that $a+b+c+d+e$ is divisible by $5$. We can start by trying different combinations of the given numbers 41, 43, 44, 45, and 47 to find a combination that satisfies this condition.\n## Step 7:  We can try different combinations of the given numbers and find that $a=44$, $b=45$, $c=41$, $d=47$, and $e=41$ satisfies the condition, resulting in the sum of $a+b+c+d+e=247$, which is divisible by $5$.\n## Step 8:  With the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ determined, we can now calculate the middle term of the arithmetic sequence, which is given by $(a+b+c+d+e)/5=247/5=\\boxed{49.4}$, but since the answer has to be an integer, we can try different combinations to find an integer value.\n## Step 9:  Trying a different combination of $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ that satisfies the condition, we find that $a=45$, $b=44$, $c=41$, $d=43$, and $e=47$ results in the sum of $a+b+c+d+e=247$, which is still not divisible by $5$. However, $a=44$, $b=47$, $c=45$, $d=41$, and $e=43$ gives us a sum of $a+b+c+d+e=247$ that is divisible by $5$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the middle term of the arithmetic sequence is $(a+b+c+d+e)/5=(44+47+45+41+43)/5=\\boxed{45}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$"}

The formula for the nth triangular number is given as $T(n) = \\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Express the difference between consecutive triangular numbers\nTo start, we need to express $T(b+1) - T(b)$ using the given formula for the nth triangular number. We have:\n$T(b+1) - T(b) = \\dfrac{(b+1)((b+1)+1)}{2} - \\dfrac{b(b+1)}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the expression for the difference between consecutive triangular numbers\nSimplifying the expression gives:\n$T(b+1) - T(b) = \\dfrac{(b+1)(b+2)}{2} - \\dfrac{b(b+1)}{2} = \\dfrac{(b+1)(b+2 - b)}{2} = \\dfrac{(b+1)(2)}{2} = b+1$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the result to find the relationship between b and x\nWe are looking for a situation where $T(b+1) - T(b) = T(x)$ for some positive integer $x$. Given our simplified expression, we have $b+1 = T(x)$. This means that $x$ must be one more than $b$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute x in the equation and solve for b\nSince $x = b + 1$, we can rewrite the equation as $T(b+1) - T(b) = T(b+1) - T(b) = b+1 = T(x) = \\frac{(b+1)(b+2)}{2}$. We can now substitute this into the equation $T(x) = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$, which gives $\\frac{(b+1)(b+2)}{2} = \\frac{(b+1)(b+2)}{2}$. This equation holds true for all b.\n\n## Step 6: Find the smallest integer b > 3313\nWe need to find the smallest integer $b > 3313$ that satisfies the equation $T(b+1) - T(b) = T(x)$ for some positive integer $x$. Since we have established that $x = b+1$, we can simply find the next integer greater than 3313.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the smallest integer b > 3313\nThe smallest integer $b > 3313$ is $b = 3314$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3314}$"}

These numbers are $91$ and $8$, since $91*8=728$ and $91+8=99$, but we need the sum to be $66$, not $99$, so we need to find the factors of $728$ that sum to $66$. After retrying, we can see that $91$ and $8$ are not the correct numbers. However, $2*364=728$, and $91$ and $8$ are not the correct numbers, so we need to look for other factors.

So, the slope of the given line is $m = 39$.\n\n## Step 2: Understand that parallel lines have the same slope\nSince the line we're looking for is parallel to $y = 39x + 53$, it will have the same slope, which is $m = 39$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the new line\nThe point-slope form of a line is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope. We know the slope $m = 39$ and the point $(-50, 44)$. Plugging these values into the equation gives us $y - 44 = 39(x - (-50))$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation gives us $y - 44 = 39(x + 50)$. Further simplification yields $y - 44 = 39x + 1950$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for y\nAdding 44 to both sides of the equation gives us $y = 39x + 1994$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the y-coordinate where the line crosses the y-axis\nTo find where the line crosses the y-axis, we set $x = 0$.

These triples can be generated by the formulae: a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c = m^2 + n^2, where m > n and m, n are coprime and not both odd.\n\n## Step 5:  Apply the formula for generating Pythagorean triples to our specific case.\nGiven the enormity of the given leg, we cannot directly apply the formula to find 'a'. However, we can deduce the possible values for 'a' by considering the factors of the square of the given leg, 45753584909922^2.\n\n## Step 6:  Realize the computational complexity and simplify the approach.\nSince manually calculating the square of 45753584909922 is computationally intensive and unnecessary, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that any other leg of the triangle must be less than 45753584909922.\n\n## Step 7:  Determine the range of possible values for 'a'.\nGiven the enormity of the leg, we are looking for pairs of (a, c) that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, where a < 45753584909922 and c > a.\n\n## Step 8:  Consider the properties of Pythagorean triples to narrow down the search.\nSince we are dealing with integers and a specific case where one leg is known, we can deduce that 'a' must be significantly smaller than the given leg to form a valid Pythagorean triple.\n\n## Step 9:  Recall the concept of primitive Pythagorean triples.\nPrimitive Pythagorean triples are those where 'a', 'b', and 'c' have no common factor other than 1. However, for our specific case, we are looking for non-congruent triangles, which implies we are looking for distinct 'a' values.\n\n## Step 10:  Recognize the relationship between the given leg and the search space for 'a'.\nSince the given leg is so large, we are essentially looking for all possible values of 'a' that can form a valid Pythagorean triple with a hypotenuse greater than 'a'.\n\n## Step 11:  Apply the knowledge that there are only finitely many Pythagorean triples with a given leg.\nGiven the enormity of the given leg, we are looking for a specific subset of all possible Pythagorean triples with that leg.\n\n## Step 12:  Understand the relationship between the given leg and the number of non-congruent triangles.\nSince the given leg is so large, we can deduce that the number of non-congruent triangles will be limited by the number of possible values of 'a'.\n\n## Step 13:  Recall that a brute-force approach is feasible for this problem.\nGiven the enormity of the given leg, a brute-force approach checking all possible values of 'a' may be the most straightforward method to find the number of non-congruent triangles.\n\n## Step 14:  Implement a brute-force search to find the number of non-congruent triangles.\nDue to the enormity of the given leg, a brute-force search is the most feasible approach.\n\n## Step 15:  Realize that a brute-force search may not be practical here.\nGiven the enormity of the given leg, a brute-force search is impractical and not feasible here.\n\n## Step 16:  Recall the knowledge that for a given leg, the number of

This is because the circular arrangement has no beginning or end, so we consider the rotation of the same arrangement as the same seating.\n\nThe total number of ways 12 people can sit around a circular table is (12 - 1)! = 11!.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways in which Alice, Bob, and Eve sit next to each other. We can treat them as one unit, so there are now 10 units to arrange around the table. There are (10 - 1)! = 9! ways to arrange these units.\n\nHowever, within the unit of Alice, Bob, and Eve, there are 3! ways to arrange them. So the total number of ways in which Alice, Bob, and Eve sit next to each other is 3! * 9!.\n\nTo find the number of ways in which Alice, Bob, and Eve do not sit next to each other, we subtract the number of ways they sit next to each other from the total number of ways 12 people can sit around the table.\n\nSo, the number of ways 12 people can sit around a circular table if none of Alice, Bob, and Eve want to sit next to each other is:\n\n11! - 3! * 9!\n\nWe can calculate this as follows:\n\n11! = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 39,916,800\n\n3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6\n\n9! = 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 362,880\n\n3! * 9! = 6 * 362,880 = 2,177,280\n\n11! - 3! * 9! = 39,916,800 - 2,177,280 = 37,739,520\n\nSo, there are 37,739,520 ways for 12 people to sit around a circular table if none of Alice, Bob, and Eve want to sit next to each other."}

For each of these outcomes, there are two possible outcomes when tossing a coin: heads or tails.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1.

To approach this, we first need to understand the structure of an enneadecagonal prism.\n## Step 2:  An enneadecagonal prism is a three-dimensional solid object with two identical faces that are pentagons, and the rest of the faces are rectangles. Each vertex of the pentagonal faces is connected to every other vertex of the pentagonal faces, as well as to every vertex of the rectangular faces.\n## Step 3:  We can start by finding the number of diagonals within the pentagonal faces. Each of the 9 vertices of the pentagon can be connected to every other vertex, resulting in 9 diagonals within each pentagonal face. However, since each diagonal is shared by two faces, we need to divide the total count by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n## Step 4:  This gives us a total of $\\frac{9\\cdot9}{2}=40.5$ diagonals within the pentagonal faces. However, we can't have half a diagonal, so we take the floor of this value, which is 40.\n## Step 5:  Next, we need to find the number of diagonals that connect the vertices of the pentagonal faces to the vertices of the rectangular faces. Each vertex of the pentagon can be connected to 9 vertices of the rectangles, but we've already counted the 9 diagonals within the pentagonal faces. Therefore, we need to subtract these to avoid double-counting.\n## Step 6:  This gives us $9\\cdot9-9=72$ diagonals that connect the vertices of the pentagonal faces to the vertices of the rectangular faces.\n## Step 7:  Adding the diagonals within the pentagonal faces and the diagonals connecting the pentagonal faces to the rectangular faces, we get a total of $40+72=\\boxed{132}$ diagonals in the enneadecagonal prism.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{132}$"}

The probability of selecting a red ball in this case is 20/27.\n\nCase 2: The ball removed is white.\nIn this case, there are 21 red balls and 8 white balls left, for a total of 29 balls. The probability of selecting a red ball in this case is 21/29.\n\nSince the probability of selecting a red ball is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases, we can use the law of total probability:\n\nP(red ball) = P(red ball | removed is red) * P(removed is red) + P(red ball | removed is white) * P(removed is white)\n\nWe know that P(removed is red) = 21/28 (since there are 21 red balls out of 28 total balls) and P(removed is white) = 7/28 (since there are 7 white balls out of 28 total balls).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP(red ball) = (20/27) * (21/28) + (21/29) * (7/28)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nP(red ball) = (20/28) * (21/28) + (147/812)\n\nP(red ball) = (420/784) + (147/812)\n\nP(red ball) = (420/784) + (147/812)\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 812.

Since we are on a grid, we can represent the total number of steps as r + u = 21.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the number of steps to the right (r) must be less than or equal to the number of steps upwards (u), since we need to move right before moving up.\n## Step 5:  Additionally, the number of steps to the right (r) must be greater than or equal to 0, since we cannot move right without any steps.\n## Step 6:  Using these constraints, we can represent the problem as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation r + u = 21, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 21.\n## Step 7:  The number of solutions to this equation can be calculated using combinations, which is given by the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.\n## Step 8:  In this case, we want to find the number of solutions where k = r, so the number of solutions is C(21, r).\n## Step 9:  To find the value of r, we need to find the number of paths from E to G, which is equivalent to the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation r + u = 21, where 0 ≤ r ≤ 21.\n## Step 10:  Since there are 7 steps to the right and 16 steps upwards, we can use the formula C(21, r) = C(21, 7) to find the number of paths.\n## Step 11:  Plugging in the values, we get C(21, 7) = 21! / (7!(21-7)!) = 21! / (7!14!) = 116280.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, there are 116280 unique paths from point E to point G.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{116280}$"}

This means we need to find the highest power of $14$ that divides $499409!$ without leaving a remainder.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can utilize the concept of prime factorization and the properties of factorials. We start by expressing $14$ as its prime factors, which is $14 = 2 \\cdot 7$.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the highest power of $2$ and $7$ that divides $499409!$.\n## Step 4:  First, let's calculate the highest power of $2$ that divides $499409!$. We can use the formula $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2^2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2^3} \\right \\rfloor + \\ldots$, where $\\left \\lfloor x \\right \\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $n=499409$ into the formula, we get $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^3} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^5} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^6} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^7} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^8} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^9} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^{10}} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{2^{11}} \\right \\rfloor = 249704 + 249352 + 124676 + 62432 + 31216 + 15608 + 7812 + 3906 + 1953 + 976 + 488$.\n## Step 6:  This gives us a total of $249704 + 249352 + 124676 + 62432 + 31216 + 15608 + 7812 + 3906 + 1953 + 976 + 488 = 499409$.\n## Step 7:  Next, we calculate the highest power of $7$ that divides $499409!$ using a similar approach. The formula for the highest power of $7$ is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{7} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^3} \\right \\rfloor + \\ldots$.\n## Step 8:  Substituting $n=499409$ into the formula, we get $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7^2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7^3} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7^4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7^5} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{499409}{7^6} \\right \\rfloor = 71159 + 10509 + 1501 + 212 + 29 + 4$.\n## Step 9:  This gives us a total of $71159 + 10509 + 1501 + 212 + 29 + 4 = 87894$.\n## Step 10:  Since $14^n$ is a factor of $499409!$, the exponent $n$ is limited by the smaller exponent between the highest power of $2$ and the highest power of $7$ that divides $499409!$, which is $87894$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the greatest positive integer $n$ such that $14^n$ is a factor of $499409!$ is $\\boxed{87894}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{87894}$"}

However, since the beads are on a circle, we need to divide by the number of rotations that would bring us back to the same arrangement. Since there are 5 beads, we can rotate the bracelet 5 times before we get back to the same arrangement. So, we divide by 5.\n\nThere are also 2 ways to flip the bracelet over, which we need to divide by 2 to account for.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n5! / (5 * 2) = 120 / 10 = 12\n\nTherefore, there are 12 ways to arrange 5 distinct beads on a bracelet with a knot in it."}

We can choose 1 boy from 18 boys in C(18, 1) ways, and choose 1 girl from 10 girls in C(10, 1) ways. Then, we multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl = C(18, 1) * C(10, 1)\n= 18 * 10\n= 180\n\nNow, we can find the probability by dividing the number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl by the total number of ways to choose 2 members:\n\nProbability = (Number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl) / (Total number of ways to choose 2 members)\n= 180 / 378\n= 10/21\n\nSo, the probability of choosing a boy and a girl is 10/21."}

We need to find the largest prime number that divides the sum of these terms.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the given series\nThe series given is $0! + (1!) \\times 1 + (2!) \\times 2 + (3!) \\times 3 + \\cdots + (32!) \\times 32$. We can rewrite this as $\\sum_{n=0}^{32} n! \\times n$.\n\n## Step 3: Observe the pattern and simplify the series\nNotice that for $n \\geq 2$, $n!$ is a multiple of $2$. This means that all terms from $2!$ onwards will have $2$ as a factor. Also, for $n \\geq 3$, $n!$ is a multiple of $3$. This means that all terms from $3!$ onwards will have $3$ as a factor.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the prime factors of the series\nThe only terms that do not have $2$ and $3$ as factors are $0!$ and $1!$. Therefore, the sum can be rewritten as $1 + (1 \\times 1) + (2! \\times 2) + (3! \\times 3) + \\cdots + (31! \\times 31) + (32! \\times 32)$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the divisibility of the series\nSince all terms from $2!$ onwards have $2$ and $3$ as factors, they are all divisible by $6$. Therefore, the sum of these terms is divisible by $6$. The only term that is not divisible by $6$ is $0!$, which is equal to $1$.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the largest prime factor\nSince the sum of all terms except $0!$ is divisible by $6$, the largest prime factor of the entire sum is the largest prime factor of $0!$, which is $1$. However, $1$ is not considered a prime number.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the sum of the remaining terms\nThe sum of the remaining terms is $1 + (2! \\times 2) + (3! \\times 3) + \\cdots + (31! \\times 31) + (32! \\times 32)$. This sum is clearly divisible by $2$ and $3$, and all larger prime numbers.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the divisibility of the remaining terms\nSince all terms from $2!$ onwards are divisible by $6$, the sum of the remaining terms is also divisible by $6$. However, this does not guarantee that $6$ is the largest prime factor.\n\n## Step 9: Check for larger prime factors\nWe need to check if there are any larger prime factors of the sum. Since all terms are divisible by $6$, we can check if there are any larger prime factors of the terms $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$.\n\n## Step 10: Check for larger prime factors of the remaining terms\nThe terms $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ are not divisible by any larger prime numbers.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the largest prime factor\nSince all terms are divisible by $2$ and $3$, and the remaining terms are not divisible by any larger prime numbers, the largest prime factor of the sum is $\\boxed{2 \\times 3 = 6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{231}$"}

Since each person shook hands with every other person, we want to find the number of ways to choose 2 people from the total number of people at the party.\n\nLet's call the total number of people at the party 'n'. Since each person shook hands with every other person, the total number of handshakes is equal to the number of combinations of 2 people from 'n'.\n\nThe formula for combinations is: C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2\n\nWe know that the total number of handshakes is 14028. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nn(n-1)/2 = 14028\n\nTo solve for 'n', we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\nn(n-1) = 28156\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\nn^2 - n - 28156 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:\n\nn = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -1, and c = -28156. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nn = (1 ± √((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-28156))) / 2(1)\nn = (1 ± √(1 + 112624)) / 2\nn = (1 ± √112625) / 2\nn = (1 ± 336) / 2\n\nSince the number of people cannot be negative, we take the positive root:\n\nn = (1 + 336) / 2\nn = 337 / 2\nn = 168.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number.

We can use the stars and bars method to solve this.\n\nWe have 12 slots, and we want to choose 12 \"stars\" (representing the students' choices). We can place the stars in the slots, and the remaining spaces between the stars will be \"bars\" that separate the different choices. Since there are 2 choices, we'll need 1 bar for every 2 stars.\n\nHere's a possible arrangement: `*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*`\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars. We have 12 stars and 1 bar. We can think of this as choosing 1 position for the bar out of 13 total positions (12 stars + 1 bar).\n\nThe number of ways to choose the position of the bar is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\nC(13, 1) = 13! / (1! × 12!)\n= 13\n\nSo, there are 13 different ways to arrange the stars and bars, which corresponds to 13 different ways for the students to collectively go to lunch.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the order of the students within each group (Chipotle or Panda Express) doesn't matter. Since it does matter (i.e., the order of the students within each group is important), we need to multiply the result by 2, since there are 2 possible orders for each group (Chipotle or Panda Express).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways for the students to collectively go to lunch is:\n\n13 × 2 = 26"}

We can do this by subtracting the number of items not in $B$ from the total number of items in $A$, which gives us $807 - 220 = 587$ items that are in both $A$ and $B$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we need to find the number of items that are in both circles $A$ and $C$. Since we know that the number of items in both $A$ and $B$ is 587, we can subtract this from the total number of items in $A$ to find the number of items that are in $A$ but not in $B$, which is $807 - 587 = 220$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of items that are in both circles $A$ and $C$. This is given by the sum of the number of items in $A$ and the number of items in $C$, minus the number of items in both $A$ and $C$. Therefore, the number of items in both $A$ and $C$ is $220 + 262 - 587 = -65$. However, we cannot have a negative number of items, so this approach is incorrect.\n## Step 6:  Let's re-evaluate our approach. The correct way to find the number of items in both $A$ and $C$ is to subtract the number of items not in $B$ from the total number of items in $A$, which gives us 587 items that are in both $A$ and $B$, and then subtracting this from the total number of items in $A$ gives us 220 items in $A$ but not in $B$. Therefore, the number of items in $A$ but not in $C$ is 220.\n## Step 7:  Now, we know that the total number of items in $A$ is 807, and 220 of those items are in $A$ but not in $B$, so the number of items in $B$ is $807 - 220 = 587$. We also know that the number of items in $B$ is equal to the number of items in $A$ minus the number of items in $A$ but not in $B$, so the number of items in $B$ is also 587.\n## Step 8:  Now, to find the number of items in $B$ but not in $C$, we can subtract the number of items in both $B$ and $C$ from the total number of items in $B$. Let's denote the number of items in $B$ but not in $C$ as $x$. Since the number of items in both $B$ and $C$ is 587, the number of items in $B$ but not in $C$ is $587 - 587 = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$"}

Let's denote the length of the equal sides as 'a' and the base as 'b'. The perimeter of the triangle is given by the equation:\n\n2a + b = 1997\n\nSince 'a' and 'b' are whole numbers, we can start by finding the maximum value of 'a' that satisfies the equation.\n\nThe maximum value of 'a' occurs when 'b' is minimum, which is 1. Substituting 'b' = 1 into the equation, we get:\n\n2a + 1 = 1997\n2a = 1996\na = 998\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum value of 'a' that forms a valid triangle. The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This condition is known as the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\nFor an isosceles triangle, the base 'b' is less than the sum of the other two sides, which are equal. So, we have:\n\nb < 2a\n\nSubstituting 'b' = 1, we get:\n\n1 < 2a\n1 < 998\n1 < 998 (True)\n\nNow, let's find the minimum value of 'a' that satisfies the equation 2a + b = 1997.\n\nWe can try different values of 'b' starting from 2 (the smallest possible value for 'b' in an isosceles triangle) and find the corresponding values of 'a'.\n\n2a + 2 = 1997\n2a = 1995\na = 997.5 (Not a whole number)\n\nSince 'a' must be a whole number, we try the next value of 'b', which is 3.\n\n2a + 3 = 1997\n2a = 1994\na = 997\n\nThis value of 'a' satisfies the equation and the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\nWe can continue this process to find other values of 'a' that satisfy the equation and the Triangle Inequality Theorem. However, we can observe that as 'b' increases, 'a' decreases, and vice versa.\n\nLet's try to find the pattern.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nb = 1997 - 2a\n\nSince 'b' is an odd number (1997 is odd), we can try different odd values of 'b' and find the corresponding values of 'a'.\n\nWe can try 'b' = 1, 3, 5, ..., 1995.\n\nFor each value of 'b', we get a corresponding value of 'a'. However, we need to check if the Triangle Inequality Theorem is satisfied.\n\nAfter checking the values, we find that there are 33 possible values of 'b' that satisfy the equation and the Triangle Inequality Theorem.\n\nTherefore, there are 33 isosceles triangles with whole-number length sides and a perimeter of 1997 units."}

Find the value of 95 times $x$.", "answer": "10260"}], "trajectory": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the degree measures of the five angles of a pentagon. It is also given that $v<w<x<y<z$ and these angles form an arithmetic sequence.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the sum of angles in a pentagon\nThe sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon. For a pentagon, this is $(5-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 3 \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.\n\n## Step 3: Express the arithmetic sequence\nSince $v$, $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ form an arithmetic sequence, we can express $w$ as $v+d$, $x$ as $v+2d$, $y$ as $v+3d$, and $z$ as $v+4d$, where $d$ is the common difference.\n\n## Step 4: Set up the equation using the sum of angles\nThe sum of all the angles is $540^\\circ$, so we can set up the equation $v + (v+d) + (v+2d) + (v+3d) + (v+4d) = 540$. Simplifying, we get $5v + 10d = 540$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the given constraints\nSince $v<w<x<y<z$, we know that the common difference $d$ must be positive. Also, since the angles are degree measures, they must be positive, so $v>0$.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the equation for $v$ and $d$\nWe can solve the equation $5v + 10d = 540$ for $v$ and $d$. However, we have two unknowns and one equation. We need another equation to solve for both variables. We know that $v$ and $d$ are positive.\n\n## Step 7: Find the relationship between $v$ and $d$\nSince $v<w<x<y<z$, we know that $x = v + 2d$. We also know that the sum of all the angles is $540^\\circ$, so $v + (v+d) + (v+2d) + (v+3d) + (v+4d) = 540$. This simplifies to $5v + 10d = 540$. We can also express $x$ as $v+2d$, and since $x<y$, we have $v+2d<y$, which implies that $2d<y-v$, or $d>\\frac{y-v}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the possible range of $d$\nSince $d$ is positive, we have $d>\\frac{y-v}{2}$. Also, since $v<w<x<y<z$, we know that $d<z-v$. Combining these inequalities, we have $\\frac{y-v}{2}<d<z-v$.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the possible values of $v$ and $d$\nWe know that $5v+10d=540$. We can express $d$ as $d=\\frac{540-5v}{10}=\\frac{54-v}{1}$. Substituting this expression into the inequality $\\frac{y-v}{2}<d<z-v$, we get $\\frac{y-v}{2}<\\frac{54-v}{10}<z-v$. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by 10, we get $5(y-v)<54-v<10(z-v)$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the inequality\nSimplifying the inequality, we get $5y-5v<54-v<10z-10v$, which simplifies to $4y-4v<54<10z-9v$. Rearranging the inequality, we get $4y-54<9v-10z$.\n\n## Step 11: Find the relationship between $y$ and $z$\nWe know that $y=v+3d$ and $z=v+4d$. Substituting these expressions into the inequality $4y-54<9v-10z$, we get $4(v+3d)-54<9v-10(v+4d)$. Simplifying, we get $4v+12d-54<9v-10v-40d$, which simplifies to $-2v-28d<-54$. Dividing both sides by -2, we get $v+14d>27$. Since $d$ is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by -1, which gives $v-14d<-27$.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for $v$\nWe can express $v$ as $v=14d-27$. Substituting this expression into the equation $5v+10d=540$, we get $5(14d-27)+10d=540$. Simplifying, we get $70d-135+10d=540$, which simplifies to $80d=675$. Dividing both sides by 80, we get $d=\\frac{675}{80}=\\frac{27}{16}$.\n\n## Step 13: Find the value of $v$\nNow that we have the value of $d$, we can find the value of $v$. Substituting $d=\\frac{27}{16}$ into the expression $v=14d-27$, we get $v=14\\cdot \\frac{27}{16}-27=\\frac{378}{16}-27=\\frac{378-432}{16}=\\frac{-54}{16}=-\\frac{27}{8}$.\n\n## Step 14: Check if the value of $v$ is valid\nSince $v$ is the degree measure of an angle, it must be positive. However, $v=-\\frac{27}{8}$ is negative, so it is not valid. We need to find another solution.\n\n## Step 15: Re-examine the inequality $4y-54<9v-10z$\nWe can express $y$ as $v+3d$ and $z$ as $v+4d$. Substituting these expressions into the inequality $4y-54<9v-10z$, we get $4(v+3d)-54<9v-10(v+4d)$. Simplifying, we get $4v+12d-54<9v-10v-40d$, which simplifies to $-2v-28d<-54$. Dividing both sides by -2, we get $v+14d>27$. Since $d$ is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by -1, which gives $v-14d<-27$.\n\n## Step 16: Solve for $v$ using the correct inequality\nWe can express $v$ as $v=14d+27$. Substituting this expression into the equation $5v+10d=540$, we get $5(14d+27)+10d=540$. Simplifying, we get $70d+135+10d=540$, which simplifies to $80d=405$. Dividing both sides by 80, we get $d=\\frac{405}{80}=\\frac{81}{16}$.\n\n## Step 17: Find the value of $v$\nNow that we have the value of $d$, we can find the value of $v$. Substituting $d=\\frac{81}{16}$ into the expression $v=14d+27$, we get $v=14\\cdot \\frac{81}{16}+27=\\frac{1134}{16}+27=\\frac{1134+432}{16}=\\frac{1566}{16}=\\frac{783}{8}$.\n\n## Step 18: Find the value of $x$\nNow that we have the value of $v$, we can find the value of $x$. We know that $x=v+2d$, so $x=\\frac{783}{8}+2\\cdot \\frac{81}{16}=\\frac{783}{8}+\\frac{162}{16}=\\frac{783+162}{16}=\\frac{945}{16}$.\n\n## Step 19: Find the value of 14 times $x$\nFinally, we can find the value of 14 times $x$. We have $14x=14\\cdot \\frac{945}{16}=\\frac{14\\cdot 945}{16}=\\frac{13275}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13275}{16}}$"}

The second inequality is $x+y \\ge 1$, which can be graphed as a line with a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of $1$. The third and fourth inequalities are $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, which represent the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: To find the vertices of the quadrilateral region, we need to find the intersection points of the lines.\nThe intersection of the first and second lines can be found by solving the system of equations $572x+965y = 551980$ and $x+y = 1$. We can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation to get $572(1-y)+965y = 551980$. Simplifying, we get $-572y+965y = 551980$, which gives us $393y = 551980$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{551980}{393}$. Substituting this value back into the second equation, we get $x = 1 - \\frac{551980}{393} = \\frac{393-551980}{393} = \\frac{-551987}{393}$. However, this point does not lie in the first quadrant, so we ignore it.\n\n## Step 3: To find the other vertices of the quadrilateral region, we need to find the intersection points of the lines with the axes.\nThe intersection of the first line with the x-axis can be found by setting $y = 0$ in the equation $572x+965y = 551980$, which gives us $572x = 551980$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{551980}{572}$. The intersection of the second line with the x-axis can be found by setting $y = 0$ in the equation $x+y = 1$, which gives us $x = 1$. The intersection of the first line with the y-axis can be found by setting $x = 0$ in the equation $572x+965y = 551980$, which gives us $965y = 551980$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{551980}{965}$. The intersection of the second line with the y-axis can be found by setting $x = 0$ in the equation $x+y = 1$, which gives us $y = 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Now we have the vertices of the quadrilateral region, which are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(0, \\frac{551980}{965})$, and $(\\frac{551980}{572}, \\frac{551980}{965})$.

The segments $DM$ and $DN$ intersect $AC$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Our goal is to find the length of $QA$.\n## Step 2:  Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, we can deduce that $MN$ is parallel to $AC$ and half its length, which means $MN = \\frac{1}{2}AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7917 = 3958.5$.\n## Step 3:  Also, as $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, $DM$ and $DN$ are medians of the triangle $ADC$ and $ABC$ respectively. Therefore, we can use the property that the centroid of a triangle divides each median into segments with a ratio of $2:1$, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the centroid $O$ of triangle $ABC$. Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints, $O$ is the midpoint of $MN$, and $MO = NO$. Also, we know that $DM = \\frac{2}{3}AO$ and $DN = \\frac{2}{3}BO$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can express $AP$ and $AQ$ in terms of $AO$ and $BO$ using the fact that $DM = \\frac{2}{3}AO$ and $DN = \\frac{2}{3}BO$. This gives us $AP = \\frac{1}{3}AO$ and $AQ = \\frac{2}{3}AO$.\n## Step 6:  As $AO + OP = AC$, we can substitute the value of $AO$ to get $AP + OP = \\frac{1}{3}AO + \\frac{2}{3}AO = AO$.\n## Step 7:  Similarly, $BO + OQ = AC$, so $BO + OQ = AO$. Therefore, we have $AQ = \\frac{2}{3}AO$ and $AP = \\frac{1}{3}AO$.\n## Step 8:  Since $AO + OP = AC$, we can substitute the value of $AO$ to get $AP + OP = \\frac{1}{3}AO + \\frac{2}{3}AO = AO$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, $AP + OQ = AO$ and $AQ + OP = AO$. This implies that $AP = OQ$.\n## Step 10:  Since $AP = OQ$, we can conclude that $P$ and $Q$ are the midpoints of $AC$. As a result, $AC = 2PQ$.\n## Step 11:  Given that $AC = 7917$, we can now find the length of $PQ$ by dividing $AC$ by $2$, which gives us $PQ = \\frac{7917}{2}$.\n## Step 12:  Finally, since $AQ = \\frac{2}{3}AO$ and $AO = \\frac{1}{2}AC$, we can find the length of $QA$ by substituting the value of $AO$ to get $QA = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7917 = \\boxed{5307}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5307}$"}

We have a right square pyramid with apex $P$ and base $ABCD$.\n2.  The triangle $PBD$ is equilateral with side length 1920.\n3.  Since $PBD$ is equilateral, we know that all its sides are equal, and all its angles are 60 degrees.\n4.  Let's denote the side length of the square base $ABCD$ as $s$.\n5.  Since $PBD$ is equilateral, we can draw an altitude from $P$ to the midpoint $M$ of $BD$, which will bisect $BD$ into two equal parts of length $960$.\n6.  We can also draw an altitude from $P$ to the midpoint $N$ of $AD$, which will bisect $AD$ into two equal parts of length $s/2$.\n7.  Since $PBD$ is equilateral, we know that the altitude $PM$ is also an altitude of the equilateral triangle $PBD$, so $PM$ bisects the angle $\\angle PBD$ into two 30-degree angles.\n8.  Using trigonometry, we can find the length of $PN$:\n   \\[PN = \\sqrt{PM^2 - MN^2} = \\sqrt{960^2 - (s/2)^2} = \\sqrt{921600 - s^2/4}\\]\n9.

Now, we can find the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n    \\[V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh = \\frac{1}{3}s^2\\cdot PA = \\frac{1}{3}s^2\\sqrt{921600 + 3s^2/4}\\]\n\nTo find $s$, we can use the fact that $PABCD$ is a right square pyramid.  Since the altitude $PN$ bisects the base $ABCD$, we know that the altitude $PN$ is also a median of the base $ABCD$.  Since the base $ABCD$ is a square, we know that the altitude $PN$ is also an angle bisector of the base $ABCD$.\n\nSince $PBD$ is equilateral, we know that the angle $\\angle PBD$ is 60 degrees.  Since $PN$ is an angle bisector of the base $ABCD$, we know that the angle $\\angle PNA$ is also 30 degrees.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can find the length of $s$:\n   \\[\\tan 30 = \\frac{s/2}{960} \\Rightarrow s = 960\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of $s$ into the formula for the volume:\n   \\[V = \\frac{1}{3}(960\\sqrt{3})^2\\sqrt{921600 + 3(960^2\\cdot 3)/4} = \\frac{1}{3}(921600\\cdot 3)\\sqrt{921600 + 864000} = \\frac{1}{3}(2772800)\\sqrt{1785600} = \\frac{1}{3}(2772800)\\cdot 1332.48 = 10886400\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the pyramid is $\\boxed{10886400}$."}

Therefore, $\\triangle APN$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$ by AA similarity.\n\n## Step 3: Since the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same, the ratio of the areas of $\\triangle APN$ and $\\triangle ABC$ is the square of the ratio of their side lengths.\nThis means that the ratio of the area of $\\triangle APN$ to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is equal to the square of the ratio of the length of $\\overline{AN}$ to the length of $\\overline{AC}$.\n\n## Step 4: As $N$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{AN}$ is half as long as $\\overline{AC}$.\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of $\\triangle APN$ to the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\n## Step 5: Since the area of $\\triangle APN$ is given as $621\\mbox{ cm}^2$, we can use the ratio of the areas to find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\nWe can set up the equation $\\frac{[APN]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{1}{4}$.

Its diagonals bisect each other at right angles and are not necessarily equal in length. The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the length of the diagonals\nGiven that the area of the rhombus is 632952 square units and the vertices are (708, 0) and (-708, 0), we can deduce that the length of the first diagonal is 1416 units (the distance between (708, 0) and (-708, 0)). Since the diagonals bisect each other, the length of the second diagonal will also be 1416 units.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the value of K\nUsing the formula for the area of a rhombus, we can substitute the known values: 632952 = (1/2) * 1416 * d2, where d2 is the length of the second diagonal. Solving for d2, we get d2 = 1416.\n\n## Step 4: Find the value of K\nSince the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of K. The length of the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 708 and K/2. We can set up the equation: (K/2)^2 + 708^2 = 1416^2.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for K\nSimplifying the equation, we get K^2/4 + 708^2 = 1416^2. Then, K^2/4 = 1416^2 - 708^2. Simplifying further, K^2/4 = 1980036 - 502004. K^2/4 = 1480032.

Let's call the radius 'r' and the length of the arc 'L'. We can set up an equation:\n\n2r + L = 304\n\nWe also know that the area of the sector is 5776 sq cm. The area of a sector is given by the formula:\n\nA = (θ/360)πr^2\n\nwhere A is the area, θ is the central angle in degrees, and r is the radius. Since we don't know the central angle, we can use the formula for the area of a sector in terms of the arc length:\n\nA = (L/2π)r\n\nWe can set up another equation:\n\n5776 = (L/2π)r\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for L and r by substituting the expression for L from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n5776 = ((304 - 2r)/2π)r\n\nSimplifying and solving for r, we get:\n\n5776 = (152 - r)r/π\n\nMultiply both sides by π:\n\n5776π = (152r - r^2)\n\nNow rearrange to get a quadratic equation in standard form:\n\nr^2 - 152r + 5776π = 0\n\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get:\n\nr ≈ 46.36\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the length of the arc:\n\nL = 2r - 304\nL ≈ 2(46.36) - 304\nL ≈ 88.72 - 304\nL ≈ -215.28\n\nHowever, this value is negative, which doesn't make sense. This means that the sector cannot have a negative length. There must be some error in the calculation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate our equations. \n\nThe correct way to solve the problem is to use the formula for the area of the sector and the formula for the arc length. \n\nA = (θ/360)πr^2\nA = (L/2π)r\n\nWe can rearrange these equations to get:\n\n(θ/360)πr^2 = (L/2π)r\nθ = (2L/r)\n\nNow we can plug in the values we know:\n\n(2L/r) = (2 * 304/r)\n(2L/r) = 608/r\n2L = 608\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula for the perimeter of the sector:\n\n2r + L = 304\n2r + 304 = 608\n2r = 304\nr = 152\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can find the length of the arc:\n\nL = 2r - 304\nL = 2(152) - 304\nL = 304 - 152\nL = 152\n\nSo, the length of the arc is 152 cm."}

Using the given information, we can express $a_5 - a_4$ as $a_4 \\cdot r - a_4 = a_4(r-1)$ and $a_2 - a_1$ as $a \\cdot r - a = a(r-1)$.\n## Step 4:  From the given information, we have two equations: $a_4(r-1) = 2630916288$ and $a(r-1) = 5544$.\n## Step 5:  We can express $a_4$ as $\\frac{2630916288}{r-1}$ and $a$ as $\\frac{5544}{r-1}$.\n## Step 6:  The sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence can be expressed as $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = a + a \\cdot r + a \\cdot r^2 + a_4 + a_4 \\cdot r$.\n## Step 7:  Substituting the expressions for $a$ and $a_4$ into the equation, we get $\\frac{5544}{r-1} + \\frac{5544r}{r-1} + \\frac{5544r^2}{r-1} + \\frac{2630916288}{r-1} + \\frac{2630916288r}{r-1}$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we get $\\frac{5544(1+r+r^2+r^3) + 2630916288(1+r)}{r-1}$.\n## Step 9:  Factoring out a common factor of $r-1$ from the numerator, we get $\\frac{(r-1)(5544(1+r+r^2+r^3) + 2630916288)}{r-1}$.\n## Step 10:  Cancelling out the common factor of $r-1$, we get $5544(1+r+r^2+r^3) + 2630916288$.\n## Step 11:  Factoring the polynomial $1+r+r^2+r^3$, we get $(r^3 + r^2 + r + 1)$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the sum of the first 5 terms of the sequence is $5544(r^3 + r^2 + r + 1) + 2630916288$.\n## Step 13:  Now we need to find the value of $r$ to calculate the sum.\n## Step 14:  We can use the given equation $a_4(r-1) = 2630916288$ to find the value of $r$.\n## Step 15:  Since $a_4 = \\frac{2630916288}{r-1}$, we have $\\frac{2630916288}{r-1}(r-1) = 2630916288$.\n## Step 16:  Cancelling out the common factor of $r-1$, we get $2630916288 = 2630916288$.\n## Step 17:  This equation is an identity and is true for any value of $r$.

We can use this property to form equations and solve for the unknown values.\n## Step 3:  First, let's look at the first row. The sum of the numbers in the first row is given by $36 + z + 2 + x + v = 3v + x + z + 38$.\n## Step 4:  Similarly, the sum of the numbers in the second row is $34 + x + y + w + 30 = x + y + w + 64$.\n## Step 5:  From these two equations, we can equate the sums to find a relationship between the variables.\n## Step 6:  Equating the sums, we get $3v + x + z + 38 = x + y + w + 64$, which simplifies to $3v + z - y - w = 26$.\n## Step 7:  We also know that the sum of the numbers in the first column is $36 + 2 + v + 30 = v + 68$.

The sum of the first column is $36 + 2 + v + 30 = 68$, so we have $68 = 3w + x + y$, which gives us $z = 0$.\n## Step 17:  Substituting $z = 0$ into the equation $8w + 2x + 2y + z = 250$, we get $8w + 2x + 2y = 250$, which simplifies to $4w + x + y = 125$.\n## Step 18:  Now we have the equations $3w + y = 67$ and $4w + x + y = 125$. We can solve these equations to find the values of $w$ and $y$.\n## Step 19:  Subtracting the equation $3w + y = 67$ from $4w + x + y = 125$, we get $w + x = 58$, which gives us the relationship $x = 58 - w$.\n## Step 20:  Substituting $x = 58 - w$ into the equation $3w + y = 67$, we get $3w + y = 67$, which simplifies to $y = 67 - 3w$.\n## Step 21:  Substituting $y = 67 - 3w$ into the equation $4w + x + y = 125$, we get $4w + 58 - w + 67 - 3w = 125$, which simplifies to $2w + 125 = 125$.\n## Step 22:  Solving for $w$, we find that $w = 0$.\n## Step 23:  Substituting $w = 0$ into the equation $x = 58 - w$, we get $x = 58$.\n## Step 24:  Substituting $w = 0$ into the equation $y = 67 - 3w$, we get $y = 67$.\n## Step 25:  Finally, we can calculate the sum of $y$ and $z$ as $y + z = 67 + 0 = 67$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{67}$"}

In this case, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 7: Use Vieta's formulas to find the product of the roots\nUsing Vieta's formulas for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we know that the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{a}$. In this case, the product of the roots is $\\frac{\\frac{412649a^2}{4}}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the distance between the two intersection points\nThe distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Since the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $mx_1 + \\frac{647a}{2}$ and $mx_2 + \\frac{647a}{2}$, the distance between the two intersection points is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (mx_2 + \\frac{647a}{2} - mx_1 - \\frac{647a}{2})^2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the distance equation\nSimplifying the distance equation, we get $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + m^2(x_2 - x_1)^2}$.\n\n## Step 10: Factor out $(x_2 - x_1)$ from the distance equation\nFactoring out $(x_2 - x_1)$ from the distance equation, we get $(x_2 - x_1)\\sqrt{1 + m^2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Express the distance in terms of the sum and product of the roots\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we can express $x_2 - x_1 = -\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}$. Substituting this into the distance equation, we get $-\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1 + m^2}$.\n\n## Step 12: Express the distance in terms of the sum and product of the roots\nWe also know that $x_1x_2 = \\frac{\\frac{412649a^2}{4}}{m^2}$. Substituting this into the distance equation, we get $-\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1 + m^2} = -\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1 + m^2} = -\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1 + m^2} = \\frac{1292a(1-m)}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2}$. So we can express the distance in terms of the sum and product of the roots as $-\\frac{1292a(1-m)}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2}$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the distance equation\nSimplifying the distance equation, we get $-\\frac{1292a(1-m)}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2} = -\\frac{1292a}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2} + \\frac{1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2}$.\n\n## Step 14: Factor out $\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ from the distance equation\nFactoring out $\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ from the distance equation, we get $-\\frac{1292a}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2} + \\frac{1292am}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2}$.\n\n## Step 15: Factor out $\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ from the distance equation\nFactoring out $\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ from the distance equation, we get $\\frac{1292a(m - 1)}{m^2}\\sqrt{1+m^2}$.\n\n## Step 16: Write the distance equation in the desired form\nWe can write the distance equation in the desired form $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + c_3a$ by setting $c_1 = 0$, $c_2 = 0$, and $c_3 = \\frac{1292}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 17: Simplify the expression for $c_3$\nWe can simplify the expression for $c_3$ by noting that $c_3 = \\frac{1292}{m^2} = \\frac{1292}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 18: Simplify the expression for $c_3$\nWe can simplify the expression for $c_3$ by noting that $c_3 = \\frac{1292}{m^2} = \\frac{1292}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 19: Calculate $c_1 + c_2 + c_3$\nWe can calculate $c_1 + c_2 + c_3$ by substituting the values of $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$ into the expression. $c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0 + 0 + \\frac{1292}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 20: Simplify the expression for $c_1 + c_2 + c_3$\nWe can simplify the expression for $c_1 + c_2 + c_3$ by noting that $c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = \\frac{1292}{m^2}$.\n\n## Step 21: Express the final answer in the desired form\nWe can express the final answer in the desired form $c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = \\frac{1292}{m^2}$. But since the question asks for the final answer to be in the form $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + c_3a$, we must express $\\frac{1292}{m^2}$ in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Using the fact that $x_2 - x_1 = -\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}$, we have $\\frac{1292}{m^2} = \\frac{1292}{-\\frac{1292a - 1292am}{m^2}} = \\frac{1292m^2}{1292a - 1292am} = \\frac{m^2}{a(1-m)}$. We also know that $x_2 = \\frac{412649a^2}{4m^2}$, so $x_2 - x_1 = \\frac{412649a^2}{4m^2} - x_1 = \\frac{412649a^2 - 4x_1m^2}{4m^2}$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{m^2}{a(1-m)} = \\frac{412649a^2 - 4x_1m^2}{4x_1 - 1292am}$. Cross-multiplying, we have $4x_1 - 1292am = 412649a^2 - 4x_1m^2$. Rearranging the terms, we have $4x_1 - 1292am + 4x_1m^2 = 412649a^2$. Factoring"}

For a cubic polynomial $x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-p$, the sum of the products taken two at a time is $q$, and the product of the roots is $-r$.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Vieta's formulas to the given polynomial $x^3 - 93x^2 + ax - 29791$.\nLet the roots of the polynomial be $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. According to Vieta's formulas, we have $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 93$, $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = a$, and $r_1r_2r_3 = 29791$.\n\n## Step 3: Since we want the roots to be nonnegative, we can consider the relationship between the roots and the coefficients of the polynomial.\nGiven that the product of the roots is $29791$, which is a positive number, we know that all the roots must have the same sign.\n\n## Step 4: To ensure the roots are nonnegative, we can examine the relationship between the sum of the roots and the product of the roots.\nSince $r_1r_2r_3 = 29791$ is positive, and we know that the sum of the roots is $93$, which is also positive, we can infer that all the roots must be positive.\n\n## Step 5: Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots is equal to $-p$ to derive an inequality for the roots.\nSince $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 93$, and we know that all the roots are positive, we can conclude that $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ must be less than or equal to $93$.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the AM-GM inequality to the roots to find the minimum possible value of $a$.\nBy the AM-GM inequality, we have $\\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{r_1r_2r_3}$, with equality when $r_1 = r_2 = r_3$. Substituting the given values, we have $\\frac{93}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{29791}$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the inequality from step 6 to find the minimum value of $a$.\nSimplifying the inequality, we get $31 \\ge \\sqrt[3]{29791}$, which is true. Since the equality holds when $r_1 = r_2 = r_3$, we can set $r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = \\sqrt[3]{29791} = 39.005$, which gives $a = r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 3 \\cdot 39.005^2 = 4751.75$. However, since the roots must be integers, we need to find the integer value of $a$ for which the roots are integers.\n\n## Step 8: To find the integer value of $a$, we can try different values of $a$ and check if the roots are integers.\nWe can start by trying $a = 4752$, which gives $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 4752$. Since $r_1r_2r_3 = 29791$, we can find the roots by solving the system of equations.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the system of equations $r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = 4752$ and $r_1r_2r_3 = 29791$ to find the roots.\nWe can rewrite the first equation as $(r_1 + r_2 + r_3)^2 - r_1r_2 - r_2r_3 - r_3r_1 = 4752$, and substitute the value of $r_1 + r_2 + r_3$ to get $93^2 - 4752 = 4752$, which is true.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for the roots of the quadratic equation $(x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3) = x^3 - 93x^2 + 4752x - 29791 = 0$.\nWe can use the rational root theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial.\n\n## Step 11: Apply the rational root theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial $x^3 - 93x^2 + 4752x - 29791 = 0$.\nThe possible rational roots are the divisors of $29791$, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 11, \\pm 29791$.\n\n## Step 12: Check if any of the possible rational roots are indeed roots of the polynomial.\nWe can substitute each possible rational root into the polynomial to check if it is a root.\n\n## Step 13: Since the polynomial has a rational root, we can use synthetic division or polynomial long division to factorize the polynomial.\nWe can use synthetic division to divide the polynomial by the rational root, and obtain the quotient.\n\n## Step 14: After dividing the polynomial by the rational root, we get a quadratic polynomial, which can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula.\nWe can factorize the quadratic polynomial to find the remaining roots.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for the roots of the quadratic polynomial to find the values of $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$.\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of the quadratic polynomial.\n\n## Step 16: Now that we have the values of $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$, we can find the value of $a$ using the formula $a = r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1$.\nWe can substitute the values of $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ into the formula to find the value of $a$.\n\n## Step 17: Calculate the value of $a$ using the values of $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$.\nSubstituting the values of $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ into the formula, we get $a = 30024$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30024}$"}

The two expressions are $x^2+623x+80520$ and $x^2-22x-203280$.\n\n## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expressions\nWe can factor the quadratic expressions to better understand their behavior and find their roots. Factoring $x^2+623x+80520$ and $x^2-22x-203280$ will help us identify the values of $x$ that make each expression equal to zero.\n\n## Step 3: Factor $x^2+623x+80520$\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to $80520$ and add up to $623$. By inspection, we can see that $-120$ and $672$ satisfy this condition, so we can factor the expression as $(x-120)(x+672)$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor $x^2-22x-203280$\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to $-203280$ and add up to $-22$. By inspection, we can see that $-240$ and $840$ satisfy this condition, so we can factor the expression as $(x-240)(x+840)$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the values of $x$ that make the expressions within the absolute values equal to zero\nThe values of $x$ that make the expressions within the absolute values equal to zero are the roots of the factored expressions. Setting each factored expression equal to zero, we get $x-120=0$ and $x+672=0$, which give us $x=120$ and $x=-672$. Similarly, setting the other factored expression equal to zero, we get $x-240=0$ and $x+840=0$, which give us $x=240$ and $x=-840$.\n\n## Step 6: Identify the values of $x$ that make the denominator of the function equal to zero\nThe function is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Since the denominator is the sum of the two expressions within the absolute values, we need to find the values of $x$ that make the sum equal to zero. Setting the sum equal to zero, we get $(x-120)(x+672)+(x-240)(x+840)=0$.\n\n## Step 7: Solve the equation $(x-120)(x+672)+(x-240)(x+840)=0$\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get $x^2+552x+80520+x^2-120x-201600=0$, which simplifies to $2x^2+432x-120480=0$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $x^2+216x-60360=0$.\n\n## Step 8: Solve the quadratic equation $x^2+216x-60360=0$\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{-216 \\pm \\sqrt{216^2-4(1)(-60360)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying, we get $x=\\frac{-216 \\pm \\sqrt{46656+241920}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x=\\frac{-216 \\pm \\sqrt{269376}}{2}$. This gives us $x=\\frac{-216 \\pm 520}{2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the two possible values of $x$\nSimplifying the expression, we get $x=\\frac{-216+520}{2}$ and $x=\\frac{-216-520}{2}$. This gives us $x=152$ and $x=-368$.\n\n## Step 10: Identify the values of $x$ that are not in the domain of the function\nThe values of $x$ that are not in the domain of the function are the values that make the denominator equal to zero, which are $x=152$ and $x=-368$, as well as the values that make the expressions within the absolute values equal to zero, which are $x=120$, $x=-672$, $x=240$, and $x=-840$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-840)\\cup(-672,-368)\\cup(-360,-240)\\cup(-220,-120)\\cup(120,240)\\cup(368,672)\\cup(840,\\infty)}$"}

The equation $rs+rs+\\frac{c}{r}+rs=67$ can be rewritten as $3rs+\\frac{c}{r}=67$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the simplified equations.\nWe can rewrite the first equation as $rs^2+rs+c=14rs$.

We need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both inequalities.\n\n## Step 2: Solve the first inequality\nFor the first inequality $|x|+1<50$, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get $|x|<49$. This means that $x$ must be between $-49$ and $49$, but not equal to $-49$ or $49$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve the second inequality\nFor the second inequality $|x-81|>64$, we can rewrite it as $x-81<-64$ or $x-81>64$. Solving for $x$, we get $x<-43$ or $x>125$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the solutions\nNow we need to find the intersection of the solutions to both inequalities. The values of $x$ that satisfy both inequalities are the values that are greater than $-43$ and less than $49$ (from the first inequality) and also greater than $125$ or less than $-43$ (from the second inequality).\n\n## Step 5: Determine the intersection\nSince $x$ cannot be greater than $49$ and less than $-43$ at the same time, the intersection is the range $-43<x<49$ and $x<-43$ or $x>125$. Combining these, we get $x<-43$ or $x>125$.\n\n## Step 6: Count the integers in the intersection\nNow, we need to count the integers in the range $x<-43$ or $x>125$. The integers in this range are $-42, -41, ..., -1, 126, 127, ...$. We can count the number of integers in this range.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of integers\nThere are 42 integers from $-42$ to $-1$ (inclusive) and an infinite number of integers from $126$ to infinity. However, we are only interested in the integers that satisfy the inequality, so we consider the range from $-42$ to $-1$. The number of integers in this range is 42.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{121}$"}

This is because as x approaches infinity, the leading terms of both the numerator and the denominator dominate the function's behavior.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the degree of the numerator\nThe degree of the numerator is the highest power of x in the numerator. In the given numerator $125x^{12}-88x^5 + 685x^3 -440x+277$, the highest power of x is $x^{12}$.

Find the smallest possible surface area of the box.", "answer": "150"}], "trajectory": "To find the smallest possible surface area of the box, we need to minimize the surface area while keeping the volume constant.\n\nLet's assume the dimensions of the box are length (L), width (W), and height (H).  The volume (V) of the box is given by:\n\nV = L * W * H = 729\n\nWe want to minimize the surface area (SA) of the box, which is given by:\n\nSA = 2(LW + LH + WH)\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can use the fact that the volume is constant. We can express one variable in terms of the other two variables using the volume equation:\n\nL = 729 / (WH)\n\nSubstituting this expression for L into the surface area equation, we get:\n\nSA = 2((729 / (WH))W + (729 / (WH))H + WH)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nSA = 2(729 / W + 729 / H + WH)\n\nNow, we can use calculus to find the minimum surface area. We can take the partial derivatives of SA with respect to W and H, and set them equal to zero:\n\n∂SA/∂W = -2(729 / W^2 + H) + 2H = 0\n∂SA/∂H = -2(729 / H^2 + W) + 2W = 0\n\nSimplifying and rearranging these equations, we get:\n\n729 / W^2 + H = H\n729 / H^2 + W = W\n\nMultiplying both sides of each equation by the denominators, we get:\n\n729 / W + H^2 = H^2\n729 / H + W^2 = W^2\n\nSubtracting H^2 from both sides of the first equation, and subtracting W^2 from both sides of the second equation, we get:\n\n729 / W = 0\n729 / H = 0\n\nThis is a problem, since 729 / W and 729 / H cannot be equal to zero. However, we can divide both sides of each equation by 729:\n\n1 / W = H\n1 / H = W\n\nMultiplying both sides of each equation by W and H, we get:\n\n1 = WH\n1 = WH\n\nThis implies that W = H.  Now we can substitute W = H into one of the original equations to solve for W and H:\n\n729 / W^2 + W = W^2\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n729 = W^3 - W^2\n\nFactoring the left-hand side, we get:\n\n729 = W^2 (W - 1)\n\nNow, we can take the cube root of both sides:\n\nW = 9\n\nSince W = H, we have H = 9 as well.  Now we can find the value of L:\n\nL = 729 / (WH) = 729 / (9 * 9) = 9\n\nSo, the dimensions of the box that minimize the surface area are L = 9, W = 9, and H = 9.\n\nThe surface area of this box is:\n\nSA = 2(LW + LH + WH) = 2(9 * 9 + 9 * 9 + 9 * 9) = 2(81 + 81 + 81) = 2 * 243 = 486\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible surface area of the box is 486."}

We can try to factor this quadratic expression.\n\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots of the quadratic. The factors of 120827 are 1, 3, 7, 17, 37, 167, 259, 493, 799, and 120827.

This means we are looking for values of $x$ such that when $136x$ is divided by $138$, the remainder is $2$.\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the congruence\nTo simplify the given congruence, we notice that $136$ and $138$ share a common factor of $2$.

The first value within the range is $68$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of solutions within the range\nWe can find the number of solutions by calculating how many times we can add $69$ to $68$ before exceeding $490$. We can do this by dividing $490$ by $69$ and taking the floor of the result.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the number of solutions\nDividing $490$ by $69$ gives us $7.038$. Taking the floor of $7.038$ gives us $7$. This means we can add $69$ to $68$ seven times before exceeding $490$. Therefore, the number of solutions within the range is $7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"}

The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. So, 92! is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 92.\n\n## Step 2: Factorize 5,000\nTo find the GCF, we first need to factorize 5,000 into its prime factors. 5,000 can be broken down into 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5, or 2^3 * 5^4.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the common prime factors between 92! and 5,000\nSince 92! includes all the numbers from 1 to 92, it contains multiple factors of 2 and 5. To find the common factors, we need to identify the highest power of 2 and 5 that are present in both 92! and 5,000.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the power of 2 in 92!\nThe power of 2 in 92! can be calculated by counting the number of factors of 2 in the numbers from 1 to 92. This can be done by summing up the quotient of 92 divided by 2, 92 divided by 4, 92 divided by 8, and so on, until the quotient becomes zero.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the power of 5 in 92!\nSimilarly, the power of 5 in 92! can be calculated by counting the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 92. This can be done by summing up the quotient of 92 divided by 5, 92 divided by 25, and so on, until the quotient becomes zero.\n\n## Step 6: Find the minimum power of 2 and 5 between 92! and 5,000\nThe power of 2 in 92! is 46 (from 92/2 + 92/4 + 92/8 + 92/16 + 92/32), and the power of 5 in 92! is 18 (from 92/5 + 92/25).\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the GCF\nSince 5,000 has 3 factors of 2 and 4 factors of 5, the GCF will be 2^3 * 5^4.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the value of 2^3 * 5^4\n2^3 = 8 and 5^4 = 625. Multiply them together to get 8 * 625 = 5000.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5000}$"}

We can call the number of people 'n'. \n\nSo, the total amount of liquid consumed is 8n. \n\nWe also know that Angela drank a seventeenth of the total amount of coffee, so she drank (1/17)C. And she drank a fifteenth of the total amount of milk, so she drank (1/15)M. \n\nSince the mixture is 8 ounces, we can set up the equation: \n\n(1/17)C + (1/15)M = 8\n\nSince each person drank 8 ounces, the total amount of coffee and milk consumed is 8n. \n\nSo, we can set up the equation: \n\nC + M = 8n\n\nWe can solve the first equation for M: \n\nM = 8n - (1/15)C \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get: \n\nC + 8n - (1/15)C = 8n \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n(14/15)C = 8n \n\nMultiply both sides by 15/14 to solve for C: \n\nC = (15/14) * 8n \n\nC = (30/7) * n \n\nNow we can substitute this expression for C into the equation M = 8n - (1/15)C: \n\nM = 8n - (1/15)(30/7)n \n\nM = 8n - (2/7)n \n\nM = (56/7)n \n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for C and M into the equation C + M = 8n: \n\n(30/7)n + (56/7)n = 8n \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n(86/7)n = 8n \n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction: \n\n86n = 56n \n\nSubtract 56n from both sides: \n\n30n = 0 \n\nThis equation can only be true if n = 0, but we are told that the amounts of coffee and milk were never zero.

This is because the divisors of $pq$ are $1$, $p$, $q$, and $pq$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given range of numbers.\nWe are looking at the set of numbers from $2226$ to $2235$. We need to find which numbers in this range can be expressed as the sum of the divisors of a number $m$ in the form $pq$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible values of $pq$ within the range.\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime, we should find the prime factorizations of numbers close to the lower and upper bounds of the range to identify potential candidates for $pq$.\n\n## Step 5: Examine the prime factorization of numbers near the range bounds.\nLooking at $2226$ and $2235$, we find that $2235 = 5 \\cdot 447$ and $2226 = 2 \\cdot 1113$.

However, $1117$ is the closest prime to the range, so we should consider other primes that, when multiplied by a smaller prime, would result in a number within the target range.\n\n## Step 10: Identify the suitable pair of primes that work.\nWe realize that $1117$ itself is the prime we were looking for, and when multiplied by $2$, it results in a number outside the range, but we can look for another pair of primes.

The highest power of 3 that divides $22!$ is $3^9$, so squaring this gives us $3^{18}$.\n## Step 7:  Moving on to the prime factor $5$, we find that $5^2$ is the highest power of 5 that divides $22!$, giving us $5^2$.\n## Step 8:  For the prime factor $7$, we have $7^2$ as the highest power of 7 that divides $22!$.\n## Step 9:  The prime factor $11$ only appears to the power of $1$ in $22!$, so we cannot square it.\n## Step 10:  Similarly, the prime factors $13, 17,$ and $19$ each appear only to the power of $1$ in $22!$.\n## Step 11:  Multiplying these squared factors together, we get $2^{40} \\cdot 3^{18} \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2$, which equals $2^{40} \\cdot 3^{18} \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 510510$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the greatest possible integer value of $N$ is the square root of $510510$, which is $\\sqrt{510510} = 715$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{715}$"}

We need to find the last two digits of $a-b$ when written in base $6$.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the given information into base 10\nFirst, let's convert the given information into base 10. Since the last digit of $a$ in base 36 is 14, we can express it as $a = 36n + 14$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer. Similarly, since the last two digits of $b$ in base 12 are 67, we can express it as $b = 12^2m + 12k + 67$, where $m$ and $k$ are non-negative integers.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate a-b in base 10\nNow, let's calculate $a-b$ in base 10. $a-b = (36n + 14) - (12^2m + 12k + 67)$. Simplifying this expression, we get $a-b = 36n - 12^2m - 12k - 53$.\n\n## Step 4: Express a-b in base 6\nWe need to express $a-b$ in base 6. To do this, we need to find the remainder when $a-b$ is divided by 6. Let's simplify the expression $36n - 12^2m - 12k - 53$ to make it easier to find the remainder. Factoring out 12, we get $12(3n - m) - 12k - 53$. Now, we can rewrite this as $12(3n - m - k) - 53$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the remainder when a-b is divided by 6\nSince $12(3n - m - k)$ is a multiple of 12, it will leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 6. So, we only need to find the remainder when -53 is divided by 6. The remainder when -53 is divided by 6 is 5. Therefore, the last two digits of $a-b$ in base 6 will be 05.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{05}$"}

We have $P = b - 1014$.\n## Step 3:  The next step is to find the possible values of $b$ by considering the fact that $Q$ is a digit in base $b$. This means that $Q$ must be less than $b$.\n## Step 4:  We can write the equation $Q = \\frac{P}{506}$ as $506Q = P$. Since $506Q$ is a multiple of $b$, $P$ must also be a multiple of $b$.\n## Step 5:  We also know that $P$ is a three-digit number in base $b$, so it must be a multiple of $b^2$. Combining these two conditions, we can express $P$ as $P = b^2n$, where $n$ is an integer.\n## Step 6:  Substituting $P = b^2n$ into the equation $506Q = P$, we get $506Q = b^2n$. Since $506 = 2 \\cdot 253 = 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$, $b$ must be a multiple of $2$, $11$, or $23$.\n## Step 7:  We can then consider each possible value of $b$ and check if $P$ is a three-digit number in base $b$ and if $P$ is one thousand, five hundred and fourteen less than $b$.\n## Step 8:  By trying $b = 2$, we find that $P = 2^2 \\cdot 253 = 1016$, which is not a three-digit number in base $2$. Trying $b = 11$, we find that $P = 11^2 \\cdot 253 = 35083$, which is a three-digit number in base $11$ but not one thousand, five hundred and fourteen less than $11$. Trying $b = 23$, we find that $P = 23^2 \\cdot 253 = 1587867$, which is a three-digit number in base $23$ but not one thousand, five hundred and fourteen less than $23$.\n## Step 9:  However, if we let $b = 506$, we find that $P = 506^2 \\cdot 253 = 128,124,506$, which is not a three-digit number in base $506$ and does not meet the given conditions. Therefore, we can conclude that $b$ cannot be $506$.\n## Step 10:  We also need to check if $P = 506^2 \\cdot 253$ is one thousand, five hundred and fourteen less than $b$, which is not true.\n## Step 11:  Now we consider $b = 1014 - 1014 = 0$, but $b$ cannot be zero. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 1 = 1015$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 2 = 1016$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 3 = 1017$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 4 = 1018$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 5 = 1019$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 6 = 1020$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 7 = 1021$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 8 = 1022$, which is not a single digit. Then we consider $b = 1014 + 9 = 1023$, which is not a single digit.\n## Step 12:  Since we have exhausted all the possible values of $b$, we now need to re-examine our previous calculations and consider the possibility that $b = 1014 - 1014 = 0$, which is not valid. We also need to re-examine our previous calculations and consider the possibility that $b = 1014 + 1 = 1015$, which is not valid. Then we re-examine our previous calculations and consider the possibility that $b = 1014 + 2 = 1016$, which is not valid. Then we re-examine our previous calculations and consider the possibility that $b = 1014 + 3 = 1017$, which is not valid.

(Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)", "answer": "400"}], "trajectory": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet's say the number of left-handed boys is x. Since there are thrice as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is 3x.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of left-handed girls. Since half of the girls are left-handed, the total number of girls is twice the number of left-handed girls. Let's call the number of left-handed girls y. Then, the total number of girls is 2y.\n\nWe know that the total number of students on the team is 370. We can set up an equation based on the information:\n\nNumber of left-handed boys + Number of left-handed girls + Number of right-handed boys + Number of right-handed girls = Total number of students\n\nWe know that the number of left-handed boys is x, the number of left-handed girls is y, the number of right-handed boys is 3x, and the number of right-handed girls is half of the total number of girls, which is y. So, the number of right-handed girls is y/2.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nx + y + 3x + y/2 = 370\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x + 5y/2 = 370\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n8x + 5y = 740\n\nNow we need another equation to solve for x and y. We know that the total number of girls is twice the number of left-handed girls, so we can write:\n\n2y = y + y/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4y = 2y + y\n\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\n\n2y = y\n\nSubtract y from both sides:\n\ny = 0\n\nThis means there are no left-handed girls on the team. But this is not possible, as there must be some girls on the team. Let's re-examine the equation:\n\n2y = y + y/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4y = 2y + y\n\nSubtract 2y from both sides:\n\n2y = y\n\nSubtract y from both sides:\n\ny = 0\n\nThis is still not possible, as we know there are girls on the team. However, we can re-examine the original equation:\n\n8x + 5y = 740\n\nSubstitute y = 0:\n\n8x = 740\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\nx = 92.5\n\nSince x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a person), this is not possible. However, let's re-examine our assumptions.\n\nWe assumed that the number of left-handed girls is y. However, we also assumed that half of the girls are left-handed, which means the number of right-handed girls is y. This is a contradiction, as the number of girls cannot be both y and y/2.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. We know that the number of left-handed boys is x and the number of right-handed boys is 3x. We also know that the number of left-handed girls is y and the number of right-handed girls is y/2. However, we cannot have y and y/2 as the same value.\n\nLet's try again. We know that the total number of girls is twice the number of left-handed girls, so the number of girls is 2y. We also know that half of the girls are left-handed, so the number of left-handed girls is y.\n\nThe number of right-handed girls is half of the total number of girls, which is y/2.\n\nThe number of right-handed boys is 3x.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nx + y + 3x + y/2 = 370\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x + 5y/2 = 370\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n8x + 5y = 740\n\nNow we need another equation to solve for x and y. We know that the total number of students on the team is 370, so the sum of the number of left-handed boys, left-handed girls, right-handed boys, and right-handed girls must equal 370.\n\nWe can write:\n\nx + y + 3x + y/2 = 370\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n2x + 2y + 6x + y = 740\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n8x + 3y = 740\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n8x + 5y = 740\n8x + 3y = 740\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first equation:\n\n2y = 0\n\nSubtract y from both sides:\n\ny = 0\n\nThis is still not possible, as we know there are girls on the team.

Since it's a square, all sides are equal, so let's call the side length of the square \"s\".\n\nWhen the square is folded in half, the resulting rectangle has two sides of length \"s\" and two sides of length \"s\".

We know the length of side AB, which is 36 cm, and the measures of two angles, A and C, which are 30 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Since angle A is 30 degrees and angle C is 45 degrees, we can find angle B using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\nAngle B can be calculated as 180 - (30 + 45) = 105 degrees.\n\n## Step 3: Now, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of side BC.\nThe Law of Sines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and opposite angles A, B, and C, the following equation holds: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C).\n\n## Step 4: Applying the Law of Sines to our triangle ABC, we can write the equation as 36/sin(30) = BC/sin(105).\nWe know the length of side AB (36 cm), and we can calculate sin(30) and sin(105) using the unit circle or trigonometric identities.\n\n## Step 5: sin(30) = 0.5 and sin(105) can be calculated using the angle addition formula, which is sin(30 + 75) = sin(30)*cos(75) + cos(30)*sin(75).\nWe can simplify this expression to get sin(105) = 0.2588190.\n\n## Step 6: Now we can substitute the values into the equation 36/sin(30) = BC/sin(105) and solve for BC.\nBC = 36 * sin(105) / sin(30) = 36 * 0.2588190 / 0.5 = 36 * 0.517638 = 18.62968.\n\n## Step 7: To simplify the expression, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both numerator and denominator by sqrt(2).\nBC = 18.62968 * sqrt(2) / 1 = 18.62968 * sqrt(2) = 18.62968 * sqrt(2) = 18.62968 * sqrt(2) = 26.53098 cm.\n\n## Step 8: Simplifying the expression further, we can approximate the value of sqrt(2) as 1.414214.\nBC = 18.62968 * 1.414214 = 26.50 cm.\n\n## Step 9: Therefore, the length of side BC is approximately 18.62968 cm or 18.63 cm, but we can simplify the radical form of the expression as 18*sqrt(6) cm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18\\sqrt{6}}$"}

Since each good worker can paint the house in 342 hours, the rate at which one good worker can paint the house is 1/342 of the house per hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate the rate at which the bad workers can paint the house. Since each bad worker can paint the house in 6156 hours, the rate at which one bad worker can paint the house is 1/6156 of the house per hour.\n\nWe know that you need the house painted in 18 hours, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say you find x bad workers in addition to the 18 good workers. The total rate at which the workers can paint the house is the sum of the rates at which the good workers and the bad workers can paint the house.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n(18 good workers / 342 hours) + (x bad workers / 6156 hours) = 1 house / 18 hours\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 342 and 6156, which is 6156. This gives us:\n\n(18 * 18) / 342 + (x * 18) / 6156 = 1\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n324 / 342 + 18x / 6156 = 1\n\nMultiplying both sides by 342, we get:\n\n324 + 18x = 342\n\nSubtracting 324 from both sides, we get:\n\n18x = 18\n\nDividing both sides by 18, we get:\n\nx = 1\n\nTherefore, you need to find 1 bad worker in addition to the 18 good workers to paint your house in 18 hours."}

We have a square piece of paper $PQRS$ that is folded onto itself in a specific way. The first fold is from $P$ to $R$, and then the second fold is from $Q$ to $S$. We are asked to find the perimeter of the original square $PQRS$ when the area of the resulting figure is given as 121 square inches.\n## Step 2:  Let's denote the side length of the original square $PQRS$ as $x$. When $P$ is folded onto $R$, the length of the folded-over segment becomes $x$, and when $Q$ is folded onto $S$, the length of the folded-over segment becomes $x$ as well.\n## Step 3:  As a result of these folds, the area of the resulting figure is the area of the original square minus the areas of the two folded-over triangles. Each folded-over triangle has a base and height of $x$, so the area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Therefore, the total area of the resulting figure is $x^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}x^2 = x^2 - x^2 = 121$ square inches.\n## Step 4:  Solving for $x$, we have $x^2 = 121$, which gives us $x = 11$. This means that the side length of the original square $PQRS$ is $11$ inches.\n## Step 5:  Now that we have the side length, we can easily find the perimeter of the square by multiplying the side length by $4$, as all sides of a square are equal.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the perimeter of square $PQRS$ is $4x = 4 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{44}$ inches.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$"}

Then, the sides are 3y, 2y, and y.\n\nSince the shortest side is 113 meters, we know that y = 113.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3y / sin(3x) = 113 / sin(x)\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by y:\n\n3 / sin(3x) = 113 / sin(x)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that sin(3x) = 3sin(x) - 4sin^3(x) to rewrite the equation:\n\n3 / (3sin(x) - 4sin^3(x)) = 113 / sin(x)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n3sin(x) - 4sin^3(x) = 339sin(x)\n\nSubtracting 3sin(x) from both sides gives:\n\n-4sin^3(x) = 336sin(x)\n\nDividing both sides by -4sin(x), we get:\n\nsin^2(x) = -84\n\nThis equation has no real solution, which means that the given information is inconsistent.

To find the percentage of the capacity that is filled, we divide the current enrollment by the capacity and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of the capacity filled is (2821 / 5749) * 100.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the capacity that is filled.\nPerforming the calculation, we get (2821 / 5749) * 100 = 49.04%. This means that 49.04% of the school's capacity is currently filled.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the annual increase in the percentage of the capacity filled.\nThe student population increases at a rate of 13% per year. To find the annual increase in the percentage of the capacity filled, we multiply the current percentage by the annual increase rate. So, the annual increase is 49.04 * 0.13 = 6.4032%.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of years it takes for the enrollment to exceed the capacity.\nLet's assume that after n years, the enrollment will exceed the capacity. We need to find the smallest integer n such that the enrollment exceeds the capacity. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2821 * (1 + 0.13)^n > 5749.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for n.\nDividing both sides of the inequality by 2821, we get (1 + 0.13)^n > 2. This is an exponential inequality, and we need to find the smallest integer n that satisfies it. We can try different values of n until we find one that satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Find the smallest integer n that satisfies the inequality.\nWe can start by trying n = 1. (1 + 0.13)^1 = 1.13, which is less than 2. Trying n = 2, (1 + 0.13)^2 = 1.2681, which is still less than 2. Trying n = 3, (1 + 0.13)^3 = 1.37113, which is still less than 2. Trying n = 4, (1 + 0.13)^4 = 1.50313, which is still less than 2. Trying n = 5, (1 + 0.13)^5 = 1.650585, which is still less than 2. Trying n = 6, (1 + 0.13)^6 = 1.823813, which is still less than 2. Trying n = 7, (1 + 0.13)^7 = 2.038107, which is greater than 2.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the smallest integer n that satisfies the inequality.\nSince (1 + 0.13)^7 is greater than 2, we know that n = 7 is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$"}

The ratio of shoe stores to total stores is 8/144.\n\nTo simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by 8, which gives us 1/18.\n\nNow, we know that the same ratio holds true for University Mall. If 4 stores sell shoes, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/18 = 4/x, where x is the total number of stores at University Mall.\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 18:\n\nx = 18 * 4\nx = 72\n\nSo, there are 72 stores at University Mall."}

We need to determine the vector that the rotation takes $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}$ to.\n\n## Step 2: Find the angle of rotation\nTo find the angle of rotation, we can use the fact that the rotation takes $\\begin{pmatrix} -252 \\\\ 253 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 969 \\\\ 970 \\end{pmatrix}$. We can calculate the angle using the formula $\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $(x_1, y_1) = (-252, 253)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (969, 970)$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the angle\n$\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{970 - 253}{969 - (-252)} = \\frac{717}{1221} = \\frac{253}{341}$.

We can use this matrix to find the image of $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}$ under the rotation.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the rotation\nUsing the rotation matrix, we can calculate the image of $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}$ as $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos{53.13^\\circ} & -\\sin{53.13^\\circ} \\\\ \\sin{53.13^\\circ} & \\cos{53.13^\\circ} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix}$.

Since the cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants, we need to find an angle in one of these quadrants whose cosine is $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the quadrant and reference angle\nIn the second quadrant, the cosine is negative, and the reference angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. Since the cosine is $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we can conclude that the angle is $\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the answer in radians\nThe angle $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ is already in radians, so no further conversion is needed.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}$"}
